        <p>Don't you just hate hearing "I'm sorry, the ice cream machine is down right now?"</p>
        <p>What if you could look and see which McDonald's locations other people
            have heard that same phrase from so that you could choose a better location to
            fulfill your ice cream cravings?</p>
